This repository provides data and scripts to analyze *Monitpora capitata* gene expression dynamics across nine life stages from pre-fertilization to adult, focusing on shifts in the gene expression network within the first 24 hours post-spawning. This analysis provides data characterizing the coral maternal mRNA complement, as well as transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming dynamics during the Maternal to Zygotic transition. In doing so, I aim to provide essential information regarding setting the stage for, and the sensitivity of, developmental success under increasing environmental stressors, as well as the potential for positive or negative carryover effects.

*M. capitata* bundles were collected from the reef during the peak releases of June 2018 and fertilized in the lab. The gametes and embryos were exposed from fertilization throughout the developmental stages to controlled ocean acidification conditions.  In order to elucidate maternal provisioning and the maternal-to-zygotic transition, mRNA was sequenced from eggs and embryos at 1, 4, 9, 14, 22, and 36 hours post fertilization (hpf), as well as swimming larvae (9 days), and adults (>years). Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C. RNA was extracted from 2-3 biological replicates for each treatment at each sampling point to determine gene expression profiles at each life stage. Samples were sequenced using Illumina stranded mRNA sequencing on the HiSeq targeting ~15 million reads per sample. See figure above for an outline of the bioinformatic pipeline.
